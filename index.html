      Peaky Blinders is a gangster family epic set in Birmingham, England in
      1919, several months after the end of the First World War in November
      1918. The story centres on the Peaky Blinders gang and their ambitious and
      highly cunning boss Tommy Shelby. The gang comes to the attention of Chief
      Inspector Major Chester Campbell, a detective in the Royal Irish
      Constabulary sent over by Winston Churchill from Belfast, where he had
      been sent to clean up the city of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
      Communists, gangs and common criminals. Winston Churchill charged him with
      suppressing disorder and uprising in Birmingham and recovering a stolen
      cache of arms meant to be shipped to Libya. The first series concludes on
      3 December 1919 â€“ "Black Star Day", the event where the Peaky Blinders
      plan to take over Billy Kimber's betting pitches at the Worcester Races.
